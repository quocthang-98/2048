# **2048: ULTIMATE**
## Repo Introduction
![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-v0.1.0-brightgreen)

_Note: The game is still in early stages of development, and it is not the complete representation of the final product._

This documentation provides all essential information about this repository: a remake of the original 2048 game created for the university's Data Structures & Algorithms course.<br>
Some parts of the code refer to the **2048 Tutorial Series** by Scott Bass (old name: FatalCubez), which can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLig6-gM-fHMGH6jmCpsxW6YbagHgCS3Jd&si=DOV_Fjm_q7aKs9-4).



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
